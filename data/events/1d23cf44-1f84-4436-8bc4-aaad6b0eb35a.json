          "text": "For my podcast, I decided to mainly focus on the personal attachment South Dallas had to me. Two friends and I from South Dallas spoke about the changes we saw as we became new adults. Our main claim is that gentrification is not a good thing, and we decided to use how we felt as our main form of argument. I used ethos because I and the two other people who participated in the podcast are primarily from South Dallas. We also used pathos because we spoke in a very emotional manner, since it had a direct effect on our lives. My auditory argument works best for those who like to listen to things on the way or the go. My issue relates to my auditory argument because there was nothing that I needed to show to both the guests and the audience. I was able to make my point by only making a small podcast."
