          "text": "In the previous ten years, both housing prices and the cost of living have risen drastically in Houston, Texas, compelling many individuals—especially those from working-class and other marginalized populations—to relocate from the city to surrounding suburbs. Perhaps the most well-known of these suburbs is Sugar Land, Once a small and much more affordable location compared to Houston. Sugar Land has become a leading destination for Houston residents being displaced and looking for affordable housing, safety in their communities, and access to good schools. Sugar Land is also becoming an increasingly popular destination for middle- to high-income families seeking urban development in the city with affordable suburban living."
