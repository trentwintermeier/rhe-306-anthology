          "text": "In my auditory argument, I claim that rent control alongside other legislation would be a solution to displacement as a result of gentrification. Throughout my audio, you can hear noises that correspond with some of the words I say in order to catch the audienceâ€™s feelings. Also, one of the first sound effects encourages the audience to imagine gentrification happening in their own neighborhood, which forces them to see how it is a problem to others. Furthermore, I provided outside research sources to highlight that rent control is a valid solution to displacement and build my credibility and allow the audience to trust my work. By promoting a solution to a problem caused by gentrification, I intended to voice this proposal to city officials and urban planners who have the power to implement these actions. My proposal of rent control relates to my audio by providing a different perspective to a problem rather than just reading a simple article. I deep dive into the audience and force them to feel certain ways with my audio effects, script, and other rhetorical appeals. Thus, tapping into an alternative way of promoting a solution and emphasizing the urgency of it. "
