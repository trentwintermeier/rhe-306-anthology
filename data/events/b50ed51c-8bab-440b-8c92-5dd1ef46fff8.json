          "text": "My particular claim made in this audiovisual argument was based on my proposal for project 3, which argues that long-term impact could be made for gentrification's effects as whole given that there was enough rhetorical discourse surrounding the topic itself. for the audio portion, i didn't want to particularly focus on the proposal itself, rather, see if i could challenge myself to make the point of why discourse around gentrification via virality should even be considered an option. this included elements from previous essays, such as notes from eliot tretter's article on gentrification rhetoric's stakeholders. I believe that rhetorical appeal is made much more simple in audiovisual format- in one spoken sentence, tone, music, and affect can provide pathos, ethos, and logos all at once. i attempted to provoke a sense of ethos and pathos through the inclusion of various quotes from admirable individuals, particularly ones who have their own unique sense of literary rhetoric- american poet walt whitman, and civil rights power martin luther king jr. while logos was easily attainable through communicating statistics and data, ethos and pathos were made much clearer in this audiovisual representation of project 3, which allowed for sound effects, voice affects, and comfortable language. It is possible this audiovisual format could act as a preference over the written essay for project 3- perhaps, it would appeal more to our current generation who commonly prefer more engaging methods of communication as opposed to writing, which has truthfully become a bit outdated in terms of the general public. the inclusion of music and comfortable language is likely to draw in a younger audience, where information and tone is more digestible. My contingent issue is strongly related to an audiovisual argument, mostly because it calls for demonstration on behalf of revitalizing gentrification's rhetoric. demonstration is audiovisual by nature- most do not find demonstration in written work or persuasively typed within a letter. the audiovisual format benefits the overall proposal- in calling for an audiovisual method of solution, an audiovisual method employed has a higher likelihood of reaching the right audience."
