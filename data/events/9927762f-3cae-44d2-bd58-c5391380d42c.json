          "text": "My proposal was to use zoning regulations to fight gentrification in Austin. The primary element of argument that I used was logos, a logical structured proposal that was rooted in evidence and an understanding of real-world processes. I then surrounded the logos with ethos that gave the argument credibility and pathos to make the audience care about the proposal. From its very name – Keepin’ Austin Ausin – the podcast expresses its core value of not losing the uniqueness of Austin as it grows. In the podcast, I present gentrification as a difficult issue that requires innovative solutions, which makes it a contingent issue. I then apply the core value to gentrification specifically to craft and evaluate a concrete proposal.",
