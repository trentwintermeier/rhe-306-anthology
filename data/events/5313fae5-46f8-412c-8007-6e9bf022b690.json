          "text": "In my visual argument, my take on a podcast \"Community Land Trusts for Small Business Preservation in the RGV,\" I explored the claim that gentrification in the Rio Grande Valley disproportionately impacts Latin-owned businesses and communities. The podcast's personal narratives, such as Pao's account of her family's business being affected, provided a compelling emotional appeal (pathos) that I mirrored in my project to evoke empathy. By incorporating statistics and research on Community Land Trusts (CLTs), I employed logical appeals (logos) to present realistic solutions, while referencing expert opinions to establish credibility (ethos). My argument specifically targeted college students, highlighting how CLTs could benefit both students and the broader community, therefore fostering a sense of collective responsibility. This approach connected to the contingent issue of urban development and its effects on marginalized communities, emphasizing the need for inclusive and equitable solutions.\n"
