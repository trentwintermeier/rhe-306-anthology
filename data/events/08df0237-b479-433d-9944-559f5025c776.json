          "text": "My script argues that Community Land Trusts (CLTs) are a sustainable solution to gentrification in East Austin, effectively using structure and evidence to support this claim. I apply rhetorical appeals—ethos through credible examples, pathos by highlighting displacement, and logos by explaining how CLTs work—to strengthen my argument. The tone and local references appeal directly to a civically engaged Austin audience concerned with equity and housing justice. My visual or auditory argument is closely tied to the contingent issue of gentrification, showing how CLTs can help preserve community identity and resist displacement. Overall, my message is both persuasive and community-focused."
