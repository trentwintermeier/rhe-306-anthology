          "text": "The visual argument employed pathos by juxtaposing a vibrant image of a new MRT station with a muted, slightly blurred image of a traditional Taipei street, aiming to evoke a sense of loss and concern for the fading community. Logos was present in the implied cause-and-effect relationship between modern development and the potential displacement of established areas. This visual contrast specifically appealed to long-term Taipei residents, particularly those who value the city's cultural heritage and fear the homogenization of their neighborhoods due to rapid modernization. The contingent issue of inadequate community involvement in urban planning is directly addressed by this visual; the stark contrast underscores the potential consequences of development that doesn't prioritize the needs and preservation of existing communities.\n"
