I wanted to show how these changes are affecting real people — especially families and farmers who’ve been here for generations. I used personal stories and emotion to help listeners connect with the issue and think about who Lockhart is really for. My goal was to speak to both locals and newcomers, hoping they’ll think about how we can grow without losing what makes this town special. Gentrification is the main issue, and to me it’s personal because it’s about protecting the place that raised me.",
