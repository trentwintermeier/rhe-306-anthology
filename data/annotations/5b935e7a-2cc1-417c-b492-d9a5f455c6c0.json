Welcome to Austin Avengers, a podcast where we will talk about the real issues reshaping our city and the people at the center of it. My name is Noah, and today we’re diving into a conversation that’s long overdue: gentrification in South and East Austin, and how we can actually fight back and slow it down with policy. If you’ve lived in Austin for a while, you’ve seen the change: once-affordable, vibrant neighborhoods are now dotted with luxury highrises and high-end brunch spots. I know I have, I’ve lived in South Austin my entire life. South and East Austin neighborhoods once known for their diversity, creativity, and cultural richness are now barely recognizable. And the people who built that culture? They're being pushed out. Displaced with nowhere to go. - In this introduction, I use my personal experience, inclusive language, and an urgent tone to build credibility and emotionally connect with listeners, setting the stage for a critical conversation about gentrification’s impact on my community."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Style","tag":"Informative"},{"category":"Style","tag":"Emotional"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Communities"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Displacement"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Stakeholders"}],"uuid":"321b833d-3634-404b-af14-357c865067eb"},{"start_time":30,"end_time":91,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"We need to be brutally honest about what’s happening. Gentrification isn’t just about new coffee shops and cool apartments, it’s about displacement. Families, small businesses, and communities that gave Austin its soul, its entire character, are being pushed out by rising rent and unchecked development. And if we don’t act fast, we’ll lose the very thing that made Austin so special in the first place. - In this part, I use direct, urgent language and strong emotional appeals to emphasize the seriousness of gentrification, challenging listeners to recognize its real consequences and take action before it’s too late."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Data"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Ethos"},{"category":"Style","tag":"Informative"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Stakeholders"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Housing"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Displacement"}],"uuid":"d3c61ea3-71e7-42e6-a511-3badffd98bf7"},{"start_time":92,"end_time":150,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"So here’s what I’m proposing: three clear policies that could help Austin grow without losing its heart.\nFirst, we need mandatory affordable housing requirements for new developments. That means every time a developer builds, a portion of those units must be reserved for low- and middle-income residents. Second, we need rent control especially in historically significant neighborhoods that are most at risk in order to protect the culture that they have built over time. And third, we need financial protections for long-standing small businesses, many of which are being priced out of the very communities they helped shape.These aren't radical ideas, they’re common sense. And other cities have done it. The question is: will Austin step up? - In this section, I use a confident and solution-focused tone, supported by clear, practical proposals and rhetorical questions, to persuade the audience that meaningful policy change is both possible and urgently needed in Austin."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Ethos"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Pathos"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Persuasive"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"informative"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Communities"}],"uuid":"7014cef3-0217-4b67-b20a-6e91cda272ca"},{"start_time":151,"end_time":400,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"This is where my journalist guest from The Daily Texan can weigh in, maybe sharing insight from the UT report or recent coverage on Austin’s affordability crisis. “Joining me now is Diego Hernandez, longtime South Austin resident and journalist from The Daily Texan who has some very useful insights on this topic.

Gentrification definitely does not affect everyone equally. Studies across the country, and right here in Austin, show that communities of color, especially Black and Latino residents, are hit the hardest. For example, sociologist Jackelyn Hwang’s research from Philadelphia found that Black residents displaced by gentrification were often pushed into even poorer neighborhoods. White residents, meanwhile, had more access to stable, wealthier areas. - In this section, I use expert research and demographic evidence to highlight the racial inequalities of gentrification, appealing to logic and justice to deepen the audience’s understanding of who is most harmed by these changes."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Data"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Ethos"},{"category":"Style","tag":"Informative"}],"uuid":"dec9b2ac-5923-477e-945b-484c8599d5a0"},{"start_time":430,"end_time":453,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"This is the exact situation residents in Austin are facing too. Once again, Austin’s own studies show the same thing: historically Black and Latino neighborhoods, especially in what’s called the “eastern crescent”, are losing their cultural identity at a rapid pace.

But clearly this is just not true. Cities like New York, San Francisco, and even Portland, have all found ways to balance growth and equity. And Austin? We’re one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. Developers aren’t going to pack up just because they’re asked to build responsibly, making this outcome we are searching for very realistic. In fact, Austin has a real opportunity right now. Lawmakers have been discussing changes like reducing minimum lot sizes and expediting permits in order to build more homes faster. But volume alone obviously won’t fix affordability. If we just build more luxury condos, we’re still excluding the people who actually need housing. That’s why affordability must be baked into every part of every growth. - In this conclusion, I directly address counterarguments with evidence from other cities, using logic and a hopeful yet firm tone to argue that responsible development and equity can coexist, and that Austin has both the momentum and responsibility to lead the way."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Ethos"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Logos"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Argumentative"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Persuasive"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Tone of Voice"}],"uuid":"ee987ee1-e63d-4c48-b20d-a82aa4f865f7"},{"start_time":519,"end_time":546,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"And also, let’s not forget about small businesses.

We must push city officials and developers to commit to affordable housing, rent protections, and cultural preservation. This isn’t just a housing issue, it’s about equity, identity, and the kind of future we want for Austin. Thanks for listening. I’m Noah, and this has been the Austin Avengers.
