Today, I want to discuss something that I find extremely important. We talk about it, it is an issue that has been overlooked, so I am here to change that. Today I will be talking about South Congress Avenue. If you live in Austin or have spent any time around here, you know the area, and you already know it's not just another street. It has always had its own culture. Live music, local artists, taco trucks, vintage stores, families walking around, small businesses that have been there forever."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Communicator"},{"category":"Rhetorical Appeals","tag":"Pathos"},{"category":"Style","tag":"Argumentative"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Students"},{"category":"Gentrification","tag":"Housing"}],"uuid":"47e5df2e-0a1b-4eae-b334-2051e626cdec"},{"start_time":60,"end_time":61,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"It's always been one of those places that make a city feel unique, in this case Austin.

That's exactly the reason why, today, I want to break down what gentrification actually means, how it's showing up on South Congress, and what Austin can do to address it in a fair way.
